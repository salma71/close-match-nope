 It's time a simple game gather what I've learned. 
 The game goes like this:
 1. The computer will think of 3 digit number that has no repeating digits.
 2. You will then guess a 3 digit number
 3. The computer will then give back clues, the possible clues are:

     * Close: You've guessed a correct number but in the wrong position
     * Match: You've guessed a correct number in the correct position
     * Nope: You haven't guess any of the numbers correctly

 4. Based on these clues you will guess again until you break the code with a
    perfect match, the game will report "CODE CRACKED"!
